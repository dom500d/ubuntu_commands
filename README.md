# ubuntu_commands
Just a small document to help me remember which ubuntu commands do what on my server.

./ - To run a .sh file or other executable I believe.<br>
chmod - changes permissions, -r for everything. <br>
cd - changes directory, .. goes up one, / to root, blank or ~ goes to home, - to last directory. <br>
